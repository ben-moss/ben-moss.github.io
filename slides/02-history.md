A Brief History of Process Automation
=====================================

<!-- [GM image] -->
<div>The term <span class="highlight">Automation</span> wasn't widely used until 1947</div>

<div class="fragment">General Motors established an _Automation Department_</div>

---

<!-- [Automaton dictionary entry] -->
<div>Prior to that the more common terms were <span class="highlight">Automatic</span> and <span class="highlight">Automaton</span></div>

<div class="fragment">_a machine which <span class="highlight">performs a range of functions according to a predetermined set of coded instructions</span>_</div>

<div>Punchcards were one of the earliest techniques for coding instructions</div>

<div><span class="highlight">Question:</span> What were the original punch cards used for?</div>

<div class="fragment"><span class="highlight">Clue:</span> Over 200 years ago!</div>

<!-- [Industrial revolution] -->
## <span class="highlight">Industrial Revolution</span> (1760-1840)

#### Hand production methods transitioned to machines

---

<!-- [factories] -->
A <span class="highlight">golden age for Britain</span> where many of the inventions originated from

---

<!-- [loom with punch cards] -->
The dominant industry through the period was textiles, and this is what led to the invention of the punch card - to describe power loom weaving patterns.

---

Throughout the industrial revolution, many improvements were made to the looms used for textile production, but even by the end of the period, no truely autonomous loom had been invented...

---

Several decades after the industrial revolution, news of the semi-automated looms had reached Japan, which was in a period of poverty at the time.

---

A young carpenter called Sakichi Toyoda had been following the news of these machines with interest, and was determined to think of ways he could help his country and those around him.

---

In 1896, Sakichi invented Japan's first self-powered loom, and continued to iterate on his design with several <span class="highlight">iterative improvements</span> such as <span class="highlight">automatically stopping the device when defects were detected</span>, and automatically changing shuttles.

---

Then, in 1924, Sakichi invented the <span class="highlight">world's first automatic loom</span>, called the "Type-G Toyoda Automatic Loom (with non-stop shuttle-change motion)" which could <span class="highlight">change shuttles without stopping operation</span>.

---

Sakichi was the first inventor to have <span class="highlight">built quality checks into the system itself</span> - a revolutionary concept in the 1920s!

---

His name and ideas live on today in <span class="highlight">Toyota Industries</span>, which has passed down through his family through the generations, and has benefited from many of the original <span class="highlight">automation and lean management principles</span> Sakichi and his successors introduced.

---

Fast forward 60 years, and we're in the 1980s... what a decade!

<!-- [images of the 80s] -->

Music, TV series, films... What films? [get examples]

War Games, Wierd Science, Airplane [auto pilot]

---

Computers featured a lot - they were still novel enough to be the central plot subject, especially with the "Cold War" and James Bond films...

---

All that stuff facinated me... I wanted to build James Bond gadgets and computer defense systems that could automate people out of dangerous situations...
