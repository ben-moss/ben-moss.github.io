A Brief History of Process Automation
=====================================

The term Automation wasn't widely used until 1947 - General Motors est. an Automation Department.

---

[Automaton dictionary entry]
Prior to that the more common terms were Automatic and Automaton - a machine which performs a range of functions according to a predetermined set of coded instructions.

#### Hand production methods transitioned to machines

A <span class="highlight">golden age for Britain</span> where many of the inventions originated from

---

<!-- [loom with punch cards] -->
The dominant industry through the period was textiles, and this is what led to the invention of the punch card - to describe power loom weaving patterns.

---

Throughout the industrial revolution, many improvements were made to the looms used for textile production, but even by the end of the period, no truely autonomous loom had been invented...

---

Several decades after the industrial revolution, news of the semi-automated looms had reached Japan, which was in a period of poverty at the time.

---

A young carpenter called Sakichi Toyoda had been following the news of these machines with interest, and was determined to think of ways he could help his country and those around him.

---

In 1896, Sakichi invented Japan's first self-powered loom, and continued to iterate on his design with several iterative improvements such as automatically stopping the device when defects were detected, and automatically changing shuttles.

Then, in 1924, Sakichi invented the world's first automatic loom, called the "Type-G Toyoda Automatic Loom (with non-stop shuttle-change motion)" which could change shuttles without stopping operation.

Sakichi was the first inventor to have built quality checks into the system itself - a revolutionary concept in the 1920s!

Fast forward 60 years, and we're in the 1980s... what a decade!

---

Q: What do you associate with the 80s?

---

Music, TV series, films... What films? [get examples]

War Games, Wierd Science, Airplane [auto pilot]

Computers featured a lot - they were still novel enough to be the central plot subject, especially with the "Cold War" and James Bond films...

---

All that stuff facinated me... I wanted to build James Bond gadgets and computer defense systems that could automate people out of dangerous situations...

---

Fast forward another 20 years... I work in academia...

Ten years on... I'm a software engineer working on stock market trading systems...
