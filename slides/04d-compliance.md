## Automated Compliance

- Problems:
  - Many factors mandate the need for compliance
    - External governance and legislation
    - Security
    - Consistency
  - Maintaining a healthy service state can be:
    - Costly (labour intensive)
    - risky (error prone)
    - time consuming (detracting from higher value work)
    - Complex to co-ordinate

Specifications capture decisions made during the design to create a platform that delivers the service you require in terms of security, resilience, performance and ongoing maintenance. But the questions to be asked are:

How will you know your platform is built to design?
How will you know if it still meets the specification 3 years into the design?
Do you know the impact of each item that is not in compliance with the design?
How do you automate and minimise the impact of updates and fixes to maintain compliance?

Project delivery assurance (time/budget/scope)
Minimise cost of ownership (throughout product lifecycle)
Improve confidence in IT (People, Process and Technology)
Conform to security and external regulation
