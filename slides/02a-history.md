<div>The term <span class="highlight">Automation</span> wasn't widely used until 1947</div>

<div class="fragment">Prior to that the more common terms were <span class="highlight">Automatic</span> and <span class="highlight">Automaton</span></div>

Note: General Motors established an _Automation Department_

<div style="width: 50%; margin-left: 5%;">**Automaton:** _a machine which <span class="highlight">performs a range of functions according to a predetermined set of coded instructions</span>_</div>

<div style="position: relative; bottom: -24em;"><span class="highlight">Punchcards</span> - an early technique for <span class="highlight">coding instructions</span></div>

Note: A keyboard, hard disk, floppy disk, and RAM all in one!

<div style="position: relative; top: -10em;"><span class="highlight">Industrial Revolution</span> (1760-1840)
<div class="fragment">The dominant industry through the period was <span class="highlight">textiles</span></div></div>


Note: Hand production methods transitioned to machines

A golden age for Britain where many of the inventions originated from

<div class="fragment">By the end of the period, no truely autonomous loom had been invented...</div>

Note: This led to the invention of the punch card - to describe power loom weaving patterns.

Throughout the industrial revolution, many improvements were made to the looms used for textile production

<div style="position: relative; top: -10em;">Several decades later, news of the looms reached Japan</div>

Note: Several decades after the industrial revolution, news of the semi-automated looms had reached Japan, which was in a period of poverty at the time.

<div style="position: relative; bottom: -20em;"><span class="highlight">Sakichi Toyoda</span></div>

Note: 
A young carpenter called Sakichi Toyoda had been following the news of these machines with interest, and was determined to think of ways he could help his country and those around him.

<div style="margin: auto; background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7); position: relative;
  width: 92%; bottom: -17em;">In 1896, Sakichi invented Japan's first self-powered loom, and continued to make further <span class="highlight">iterative improvements</span> such as automatically changing shuttles and <span class="highlight">automatically stopping the device when defects were detected</span>.</div>

<div style="margin: auto; background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7); position: relative;
  width: 92%; top: -10em;">In 1924, Sakichi invented the <span class="highlight">world's first automatic loom</span>, called the "_Type-G Toyoda Automatic Loom (with non-stop shuttle-change motion)_" which could <span class="highlight">change shuttles without stopping operation</span>.</div>

<div style="position: relative; bottom: -20em; width: 38%; margin-left: 60%;">Sakichi was the first inventor to have <span class="highlight">built quality checks into the system itself</span> - a revolutionary concept in the 1920s!</div>
