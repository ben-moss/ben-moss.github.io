Jido
The Toyota term applied to a machine with a built-in device for making judgments

 whereas the regular Japanese term "jido" (automation) is simply applied to a machine that moves on its own. Jidoka refers to "automation with a human touch," as opposed to a machine that simply moves under the monitoring and supervision of an operator.

- Loom stopped when a problem arose
- No defective products were produced
- Single operator could be put in charge of numerous looms
- Tremendous improvement in productivity

Jidoka and Visual Control
Since equipment stops when a problem arises, a single operator can visually monitor and efficiently control many machines. As an important tool for this "visual control" or "problem visualization," Toyota plants use a problem display board system called "andon" that allows operators to identify problems in the production line with only a glance.

## Automated Configuration Management

- Install packages, configure software, start/stop services
- Ensure the state of a machine
- Ensure policies and standards are in place
- Provide history of changes for a system
- Repeatable way to rebuild a system
- Orchestrate a cluster of services together

---

## Scope of Configuration Management

- Above Base OS install

---

- Everything as Code





Link process automation to customer problems
- Partly done in use cases

Strip out highly technical/theoretical elements

---

Tie message into complexity of cloud transition and how automation is key to success and leverage of that.

---

Stress on:
- Everything as Code - give examples
- 3 Pillars of IT
- Skills gap?
- CapEx / OpEx tradeoffs

---

Use examples from Engineering work/demos
- Compliance
- Failover Automation
- Build automation
- Infra as Code - from software to systems
  - Contrast: Quality checks
  - Timing involved
  - Where costly parts of project delivery are
