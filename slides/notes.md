- Ensure the state of a machine
- Ensure policies and standards are in place
- Provide history of changes for a system
- Repeatable way to rebuild a system
- Orchestrate a cluster of services together

---

## Scope of Configuration Management

- Above Base OS install

---

- Everything as Code





Link process automation to customer problems
- Partly done in use cases

Strip out highly technical/theoretical elements

---

Tie message into complexity of cloud transition and how automation is key to success and leverage of that.

Finish use cases

---

Stress on:
- Everything as Code - give examples
- 3 Pillars of IT
- Skills gap?
- CapEx / OpEx tradeoffs

---

Use examples from Engineering work/demos
- Compliance
- Failover Automation
- Build automation
- Infra as Code - from software to systems
  - Contrast: Quality checks
  - Timing involved
  - Where costly parts of project delivery are
