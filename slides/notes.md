A Brief History of Process Automation
=====================================

[GM image]
The term Automation wasn't widely used until 1947 - General Motors est. an Automation Department.

[Automaton dictionary entry]
Prior to that the more common terms were Automatic and Automaton - a machine which performs a range of functions according to a predetermined set of coded instructions.

[punch card]
That description might conjour up images of a punch card - the original keyboard, hard disk, floppy disk, and RAM all in one! But this idea even pre-dates early computing devices...

[Ask the audience: Any ideas where and when the original punch cards were used?]

[Industrial revolution]
~~~1760-1840 Transition to new manufacturing processes: Hand production methods -> machines.

[factories]
Steam and factories - it was was a golden age for Britain where many of the inventions originated from

[loom with punch cards]
The dominant industry through the period was textiles, and this is what led to the invention of the punch card - to describe power loom weaving patterns.

Throughout the industrial revolutionmany improvements were made to the looms used for textile production, but even by the end of the period, no truely autonomous loom had been invented...

automation... building quality into the system

Fast forward X years. It's the 1980s...
What a decade! What do you associate with the 80s?
Music, TV series, films... What films? [get examples]

War Games, Wierd Science, Airplane [auto pilot]

Computers featured a lot - they were still novel enough to be the central plot subject, especially with the "Cold War" and James Bond films...

All that stuff facinated me... I wanted to build James Bond gadgets and computer defense systems that could automate people out of dangerous situations...

Fast forward another 20 years... I work in academia...

Ten years on... I'm a software engineer working on stock market trading systems...




History

In 1896, Sakichi Toyoda invented Japan's first self-powered loom called the "Toyoda Power Loom."

Iterative improvements:
- Weft-breakage automatic stopping device (stopped the loom when a thread breakage was detected);
- Warp supply device 
- Automatic shuttle changer.

 Then, in 1924, Sakichi invented the world's first automatic loom, called the "Type-G Toyoda Automatic Loom (with non-stop shuttle-change motion)" which could change shuttles without stopping operation.

Jido
The Toyota term applied to a machine with a built-in device for making judgments

 whereas the regular Japanese term "jido" (automation) is simply applied to a machine that moves on its own. Jidoka refers to "automation with a human touch," as opposed to a machine that simply moves under the monitoring and supervision of an operator.

- Loom stopped when a problem arose
- No defective products were produced
- Single operator could be put in charge of numerous looms
- Tremendous improvement in productivity

Jidoka and Visual Control
Since equipment stops when a problem arises, a single operator can visually monitor and efficiently control many machines. As an important tool for this "visual control" or "problem visualization," Toyota plants use a problem display board system called "andon" that allows operators to identify problems in the production line with only a glance.

## Automated Configuration Management

- Install packages, configure software, start/stop services
- Ensure the state of a machine
- Ensure policies and standards are in place
- Provide history of changes for a system
- Repeatable way to rebuild a system
- Orchestrate a cluster of services together

---

## Scope of Configuration Management

- Above Base OS install

---

- Everything as Code





Link process automation to customer problems
- Partly done in use cases

Strip out highly technical/theoretical elements

---

Tie message into complexity of cloud transition and how automation is key to success and leverage of that.

Finish use cases

---

Stress on:
- Everything as Code - give examples
- 3 Pillars of IT
- Skills gap?
- CapEx / OpEx tradeoffs

---

Use examples from Engineering work/demos
- Compliance
- Failover Automation
- Build automation
- Infra as Code - from software to systems
  - Contrast: Quality checks
  - Timing involved
  - Where costly parts of project delivery are
